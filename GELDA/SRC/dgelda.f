C     PURPOSE
C
C     DGELDA solves linear differentiell algebraic equations (DAEs) with
C     variable coefficients of the form
C
C                           .
C                       E(t)x(t) = A(t)x(t) +f(t)
C                          x(t0) = x0.
C
C     for x in a specified range of the independent variable t.
C
C     ARGUMENT LIST
C
C       USER-SUPPLIED SUBROUTINES
C
C      EDIF - User supplied SUBROUTINE.
C             This is a subroutine which the user provides to define the
C             matrix E(t) and its derivatives. It has the form
C
C             SUBROUTINE EDIF(N,T,IDIF,E,LDE,IPAR,RPAR,IERR).
C
C             The subroutine takes as input the number of equations N,
C             the time T and the integer parameter IDIF. EDIF must not
C             alter these input parameters or the leading dimension LDE
C             of the array E. As output, the subroutine produces the
C             IDIF-th derivative of E(t) at time T in the leading N by N
C             part of the array E. The integer flag IERR is always zero
C             on input and EDIF should alter IERR only if IDIF is larger
C             than the highest derivative of E(t) the subroutine
C             provides (set IERR=-2) or if another problem occurs (set
C             IERR=-1). IPAR and RPAR are integer and real arrays which
C             can be used for the communication between the user's
C             calling program and the subroutines EDIF, ADIF and FDIF.
C
C             In the calling program, EDIF must be declared as external.
C
C      ADIF - User supplied SUBROUTINE.
C             This is a subroutine which the user provides to define the
C             matrix A(t) and its derivatives. It is of the form
C
C              SUBROUTINE ADIF(N,T,IDIF,A,LDA,IPAR,RPAR,IERR)
C
C             and the input and output parameters are similar to these
C             of EDIF.
C
C      FDIF - User supplied SUBROUTINE.
C             This is a subroutine which the user provides to define the
C             vector f(t) and its derivatives. It is of the form
C
C             SUBROUTINE FDIF(N,T,IDIF,F,IPAR,RPAR,IERR)
C
C             and the input and output parameters are similar to these
C             of EDIF. Except that the first N elements of the
C             1-dimensional array F contain the IDIF-th derivative of
C             f(t) at time T. Note further, since F is a 1-dimensional
C             array no leading dimension is needed.
C
C       ARGUMENTS IN
C
C         N - INTEGER.
C             The number of equations.
C             N .GE. 1.
C
C         T - DOUBLE PRECISION.
C             The initial point of the integration.
C             NOTE that this scalar is overwritten.
C
C      TOUT - DOUBLE PRECISION.
C             The point at which a solution is desired. Integration
C             either forward in T (TOUT > T) or backward in T (TOUT < T)
C             is allowed.
C
C             At the beginning of the integration (INFO(1)=0, see below)
C             the user can set T = TOUT. The code will then compute the
C             strangeness index and the number of differential,
C             algebraic and undetermined equations and return this
C             values in CVAL. Furthermore, if INFO(11)=0 consistent
C             initial values will be computed and stored in X.
C
C         X - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION (N).
C             If INFO(11)=0, this array can contain a guess for the
C             initial value. A consistent initial value close (in the
C             least square sense) to this guess is then computed. If no
C             guess is available, set all elements of X to zero.
C
C             If INFO(11)=1, this array must contain consistent initial
C             values of the N solution components at the initial point
C             T.
C             NOTE that this array is overwritten.
C
C       ARGUMENTS OUT
C
C         T - DOUBLE PRECISION.
C             The solution was successfully advanced to the output value
C             of T.
C
C         X - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION (N).
C             Contains the computed solution approximation at T.
C
C    XPRIME - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION (N).
C             Contains the computed first derivative of the solution
C             approximation at T.
C      CVAL - INTEGER array of DIMENSION (4).
C             Contains the characteristic values of the DAE:
C             CVAL(1) contains the strangeness index MU.
C             CVAL(2) contains the number DMU of differential
C                     components.
C             CVAL(3) contains the number AMU of algebraic components.
C             CVAL(4) contains the number UMU of undetermined
C                     components.
C
C      IPAR - INTEGER array of DIMENSION (*).
C             This integer array can be used for communication between
C             the calling program and the EDIF, ADIF and FDIF
C             subroutines.
C
C      RPAR - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION (*).
C             This real array can be used for communication between the
C             calling program and the EDIF, ADIF and FDIF subroutines.
C
C             IPAR and RPAR are not altered by DGELDA or its
C             subprograms. If these arrays are used, they must be
C             dimensioned in the calling program and in EDIF, ADIF and
C             FDIF as arrays of appropriate length. Otherwise, ignore
C             these arrays by treating them as dummy arrays of length
C             one.
C
C     RWORK, IWORK - See WORKSPACE
C             These real and integer arrays provide the workspace (see
C             below).
C             Usually the information they contain are of no interest,
C             but sometimes the following may be useful:
C             IWORK(7)  contains the order of the method to be attempted
C                       on the next step.
C             IWORK(8)  contains the order of the method used on the last
C                       step.
C             IWORK(11) contains the number of steps taken so far.
C             IWORK(12) contains the number of calls to EDIF, ADIF and
C                       FDIF so far.
C             IWORK(13) contains the number of factorizations of the
C                       system matrix so far.
C             IWORK(14) contains the total number of error test failures
C                       so far.
C             RWORK(3)  contains the stepsize H to be attempted on the
C                       next step.
C             RWORK(4)  contains the current value of the independent
C                       variable, i.e., the farthest point integration
C                       has reached. This will be different from T only
C                       when interpolation has been performed (IERR=3).
C             RWORK(7)  contains the stepsize used on the last successful
C                       step.
C
C     WORK SPACE
C
C     IWORK - INTEGER array of DIMENSION at least (LIW).
C
C       LIW - INTEGER.
C             The length of IWORK.
C             If METHOD = 1 then LIW .GE. 20+2*N.
C             If METHOD = 2 then LIW .GE. 20+6*N.
C
C      RWORK - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION at least (LRW).
C
C       LRW - NTEGER.
C             The length of RWORK.
C             If METHOD = 1 then
C               LRW .GE. 50 + (21 + MAXORD + 14*MXINDX)*N
C                    + (6 + MXINDX + 6*(MXINDX+1)^2)*N^2.
C             If METHOD = 2 then
C               LRW .GE. 20 + (29 + 14*MXINDX)*N
C                    + (15 + MXINDX + 6*(MXINDX+1)^2)*N^2.
C             NOTE that for good performance, LRW should generally be
C             larger.
C
C     TOLERANCES
C
C      RTOL - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION (*)
C             The relative error tolerances which the user provides to
C             indicate how accurately he wishs the solution to be
C             computed. The user may choose RTOL and ATOL to be both
C             scalars or else both vectors.
C             If RTOL and ATOL are scalars (INFO(2)=0) the user has to
C             declare this array to be RTOL(1).
C
C      ATOL - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION (*)
C             The absolute error tolerances which the user provides.
C             If ATOL and RTOL are scalars (INFO(2)=0) the user has to
C             declare  this array to be ATOL(1).
C
C             The tolerances are used by the code in a local error test
C             at each step which requires roughly that
C             |LOCAL ERROR| .LE. RTOL*|X| + ATOL
C             for each vector component.
C
C             The true (global) error is the difference between the true
C             solution of the initial value problem and the computed
C             approximation. Practically all present day codes,
C             including this one, control the local error at each step
C             and do not even attempt to control the global error directly.
C
C             Usually, but not always, the true accuracy of the computed
C             X is comparable to the error tolerances. This code will
C             usually, but not always, deliver a more accurate solution
C             if the user reduces the tolerances and  integrate again.
C             By comparing two such solutions the user can get a fairly
C             reliable idea of the true error in the solution at the
C             bigger tolerances.
C
C             Setting ATOL=0 results in a pure relative error test on
C             that component. Setting RTOL=0 results in a pure absolute
C             error test on that component. A mixed test with non-zero
C             RTOL and ATOL corresponds roughly to a relative error test
C             when the solution component is much bigger than ATOL and
C             to an absolute error test when the solution component is
C             smaller than the threshold ATOL.
C
C             The code will not attempt to compute a solution at an
C             accuracy unreasonable for the machine being used. It will
C             advise the user if he asks for too much accuracy and
C             inform the user as to the maximum accuracy it believes
C             possible.
C
C     MODE PARAMETERS
C
C    METHOD - INTEGER.
C             Indicates which integration method should be used as
C             follows:
C             METHOD=1 the code uses the BDF solver.
C             METHOD=2 the code uses the Runge-Kutta solver.
C
C      INFO - INTEGER array of DIMENSION (20)
C             The basic task of the code is to solve the system from T
C             to TOUT and return an answer at TOUT. INFO is an integer
C             array which is used to communicate exactly how the user
C             wants this task to be carried out. The simplest use of the
C             code corresponds to setting all entries of INFO to 0 (See
C             below).
C
C     WARNING INDICATOR
C
C     IWARN - INTEGER.
C             Is always zero in this version of DGELDA.
C
C     ERROR INDICATOR
C
C      IERR - INTEGER.
C             Unless the code detects an error (see next section), IERR
C             contains a positive value on exit.
C             IERR = 1: In the BDF-solver (METHOD=1) a step was
C                       successfully taken in the intermediate-output
C                       mode. The code has not yet reached TOUT.
C             IERR = 2: The integration to TOUT was successfully completed
C                       (T=TOUT) by stepping exactly to TOUT.
C             IERR = 3: In the BDF-solver the integration to TOUT was
C                       successfully completed (T=TOUT) by stepping past
C                       TOUT. X is obtained by interpolation.
C             IERR = 4: At the first step the user set T=TOUT and the code
C                       computed successfully the strangeness index and
C                       the other characteristic quantities. Furthermore,
C                       if INFO(11)=0, consistent initial values are
C                       stored in X.
C

C
C     METHOD
C
C     The most important invariant in the analysis of linear DAE's is
C     the so called STRANGENESS INDEX [4], which generalizes the
C     differential index [1] for systems with undetermined components.
C
C     The implementation of DGELDA [5] is based on the construction of
C     the discretization scheme introduced in [3], which first
C     determines all the local invariants and then transforms the system
C     into a strangeness-free DAE with the same solution set.
C
C     The strangeness-free DAE is solved by either BDF methods, which
C     were adapted from DASSL of Petzold [6], or a Runge-Kutta method,
C     which was adapted from RADAU5 of Hairer/Wanner [2].

C     FURTHER COMMENTS
C
C       SETTING UP THE INFO ARRAY BEFORE THE FIRST CALL
C
C         This array is used to give the code more details about how the
C         user wants his problem to be solved. The user must respond to
C         all of the following items, which are arranged as
C         questions. The simplest use of the code corresponds to
C         answering all questions as yes, i.e. setting all entries of
C         INFO to 0.
C
C         INFO(1) This parameter enables the code to initialize
C                 itself. The user must set it to indicate the start of
C                 every new problem.
C                 Is this the first call for this problem ...
C                 Yes - Set INFO(1)=0
C                 No  - Not applicable here.
C                       See below for continuation calls.
C
C         INFO(2) The error tolerances RTOL and ATOL are used to specify
C                 how much  accuracy the user wants. The simplest use is
C                 to take them both to be scalars. To obtain more
C                 flexibility, they can both be vectors.
C                 Are both error tolerances RTOL, ATOL scalars ...
C                 Yes - Set INFO(2) = 0
C                       and input scalars for both RTOL and ATOL
C                 No  - Set INFO(2) = 1
C                       and input arrays for both RTOL and ATOL
C
C         INFO(3) The code integrates from T in the direction of TOUT by
C                 steps. If the user wishs, it will return the computed
C                 solution at the next intermediate step (the
C                 intermediate-output mode) or TOUT, whichever comes
C                 first. If the user must have solutions at many
C                 specific TOUT points, this code will compute them
C                 efficiently.
C                 Do you want the solution only at TOUT (and not at the
C                 next intermediate step) ...
C                 Yes - Set INFO(3) = 0
C                 No  - Set INFO(3) = 1.
C
C         INFO(4) If the user uses the BDF--solver (METHOD=1), the code
C                 may integrate past TOUT and interpolate to obtain the
C                 result at TOUT, to handle solutions at many specific
C                 values TOUT efficiently. Sometimes it is not possible
C                 to integrate beyond some  point TSTOP because the
C                 equation changes there or it is not defined past
C                 TSTOP. Then the user must tell the code not to go past.
C                 Can the integration be carried out without any
C                 restrictions on the independent variable T ...
C                 Yes-  Set INFO(4)=0
C                 No  - Set INFO(4)=1
C                       and define the stopping point TSTOP by setting
C                       RWORK(1)=TSTOP,
C
C         INFO(5) The code assumes that the user wants to solve a time
C                 dependent problem. If E(t) and A(t) are both constant
C                 the user can help the code.
C                 Are E(t) or A(t) time dependent ...
C                 Yes - Set INFO(5)=0
C                 No  - Set INFO(5)=1.
C
C         INFO(7) The user can specify a maximum (absolute value of)
C                 stepsize, so that the code will avoid passing over
C                 very large regions.
C                 Do you want the code to decide on its own maximum
C                 stepsize ...
C                 Yes - Set INFO(7)=0
C                 No  - Set INFO(7)=1
C                       and define HMAX by setting RWORK(2)=HMAX.
C
C         INFO(8) Differential/algebraic problems may occasionally
C                 suffer from severe scaling difficulties on the first
C                 step. If the user knows a great deal about the scaling
C                 of his problem, he can help to alleviate this problem
C                 by specifying an initial stepsize H0.
C                 Do you want the code to define its own initial
C                 stepsize ...
C                 Yes - Set INFO(8)=0
C                 No  - Set INFO(8)=1
C                       and define H0 by setting RWORK(3)=H0.
C
C         INFO(9) If storage is a severe problem and the user use the
C                 BDF-solver (METHOD=1), he can save some memory by
C                 restricting the maximum order MAXORD. The default
C                 value is 5. For each order decrease below 5, the code
C                 requires fewer locations, however it is likely to be
C                 slower. In any case, the user must have 1.LE.MAXORD 5.
C                 Do you want the maximum order to default to 5 ...
C                 Yes - Set INFO(9)=0
C                 No  - Set INFO(9)=1
C                       and define MAXORD by setting IWORK(3)=MAXORD.
C
C        INFO(10) The code tries to calculate the strangeness index of
C                 the problem, however it needs more memory for high
C                 index problems. The default value for the maximum
C                 index MXINDX is 3. The user can decrease it below 3 to
C                 save memory (if the index of his problem is smaller
C                 than 3) or increase it to solve a higher index
C                 problem. Note, that EDIF, ADIF and FDIF must provide
C                 E(t), A(t), F(t) and (maybe) their first MXINDX
C                 derivatives. In any case, the user must have MXINDX.GE.0.
C                 Do you want the maximum index to default to 3 ...
C                 Yes - Set INFO(10)=0
C                 No  - Set INFO(10)=1
C                       and define MAXINDX by setting IWORK(4)=MAXINDX.
C
C        INFO(11) In this code it is not neccesary to provide consistent
C                 initial conditions. Using the special structure of the
C                 strangeness free DAE, the code can compute consistent
C                 initial values to start the integration (see also
C                 INFO(12)). However, often consistent initial values
C                 are known and the code should use these values.
C                 Do you want the code to compute consistent initial
C                 values ...
C                 Yes - Set INFO(11)=0
C                 No  - Set INFO(11)=1
C                       and input consistent initial values in X.
C
C        INFO(12) If INFO(11)=0, the code computes consistent initial
C                 values in the least squares sense. The default method
C                 is to  compute consistent initial values which are
C                 close (in the least squares sense) to the given
C                 X. Sometimes the user knows which are the differential
C                 variables and he wants to prescribe these variables.
C                 In this case, the user can use a different method,
C                 which keeps the differential variables fixed.
C                 Do you want the code to use the default method for
C                 computing consistent initial values ...
C                 Yes - Set INFO(12)=0
C                 No  - Set INFO(12)=1.
C
C        INFO(14) A maximum number of steps NMAX must be specified in
C                 order to prevent the code from computing infinitely
C                 further in the case of repeated step rejection. The
C                 default value for NMAX is 10 000.
C                 Do you want the maximum number of steps to default to
C                 10 000 ...
C                 Yes - Set INFO(11)=0
C                 No  - Set INFO(11)=1
C                       and define NMAX by setting IWORK(20)=NMAX.
C
C        INFO(15) For the Runge--Kutta branch, the user can choose
C                 between two step size strategies. If not specified
C                 otherwise, the code will use the modified predictive
C                 controller of Gustafsson, which seems to produce
C                 safer results. As alternative for simple problems, the
C                 user can apply the classical step size control which
C                 produces often slightly faster runs.
C                 Do you want to use the predictive controller of
C                 Gustafsson ...
C                 Yes - Set INFO(12)=0
C                 No  - Set INFO(12)=1.
C
C        INFO(16) For the Runge--Kutta branch, a safety factor SAFE in
C                 step size prediction is used in the formula for
C                 calculating the new step size in dependency of the old
C                 one and the error norm. The smaller SAFE is chosen,
C                 the more the new step size is restricted. SAFE must
C                 lie in the interval (0.001,1). The default value is
C                 SAFE=0.9. Furthermore, parameters FACL, FACR for
C                 step size selection restrict the relation between the
C                 old and the new stepsize. The new step size is chosen
C                 subject to 1/FACL.LE.HNEW/HOLD.LE.1/FACR. The default
C                 values are FACL=5.0 and FACR=0.125.
C                 Do you want SAFE, FACL, FACR to default to $0.9, 5.0$
C                 and 0.125, respectively ...
C                 Yes - Set INFO(13)=0
C                 No  - Set INFO(13)=1
C                       and define SAFE, FACL, FACR by setting
C                       RWORK(11)=SAFE,  RWORK(12)=FACL, RWORK(13)=FACR.
C
C        INFO(17) For the Runge--Kutta branch, if HNEW is not far from
C                 HOLD (QUOT1 < HNEW/HOLD < QUOT2) and the matrices E
C                 and A are constant, work can be saved by setting
C                 HNEW=HOLD and using the system matrix of the previous
C                 step, so that a new LU--decomposition is not
C                 necessary. For small systems one may have QUOT1=1.0,
C                 QUOT2=1.2, for large full systems QUOT1=0.99,
C                 QUOT2=2.0 might be good. Default values are QUOT1=1.0,
C                 QUOT2=1.2.
C                 Do you want QUOT1, QUOT2 to default to 1.0 and 1.2,
C                 respectively ...
C                 Yes - Set INFO(14)=0
C                 No  - Set INFO(14)=1
C                      and define QUOT1, QUOT2 by setting
C                      RWORK(14)=QUOT1, RWORK(15)=QUOT2.
C
C       CONTINUING THE INTEGRATION
C
C       The user must monitor the IERR parameter in order to determine
C       what to do next.
C
C       Do not alter any quantity not specifically permitted below, in
C       particular do not alter N, T, X(*), RWORK(*), IWORK(*) or the
C       differential equation in subroutines EDIF, ADIF and FDIF. Any
C       such alteration constitutes a new problem and must be treated as
C       such, i.e., the user must start afresh. The user cannot change
C       from vector to scalar error control or vice versa (INFO(2)), but
C       he can change the size of the entries of RTOL and ATOL.
C       Increasing a tolerance makes the equation easier to integrate.
C       Decreasing a tolerance will make the equation harder to
C       integrate and should generally be avoided.
C
C       The user can switch from the intermediate-output mode to the
C       interval mode (INFO(3)) or vice versa at any time.
C
C       If it has been necessary to prevent the integration from going
C       past a point TSTOP (INFO(4), RWORK(1)), keep in mind that the
C       code will not integrate to any TOUT beyond the currently
C       specified TSTOP. Once TSTOP has been reached the user must
C       change the value of TSTOP or set INFO(4)=0. The user may change
C       INFO(4) or TSTOP at any time but he must supply the value of
C       TSTOP in RWORK(1) whenever he set INFO(4)=1.
C
C       The user should not change INFO(5), IWORK(1), or IWORK(2) unless
C       he is going to restart the code.
C
C                   *** Following a completed task ***
C
C       If
C       IERR = 1 call the code again to continue the integration
C                another step in the direction of TOUT.
C       IERR = 2 or 3 define a new TOUT and call the code again. TOUT
C                must be different from T. The user cannot change the
C                direction of integration without restarting.
C       IERR = 4 define a new TOUT and call the code again. TOUT must be
C                different from T.
C
C                   *** Following an interrupted task ***
C
C       To show the code that the user realizes the task was interrupted
C       and that he wants to continue, he must take appropriate action
C       and set INFO(1)=1.
C
C       If
C       IERR = -1  DGELDA has taken  10000 steps. If the user wants to
C                  continue, set INFO(1)=1 and call the code again. An
C                  additional 10000 steps will be allowed.
C       IERR = -2  The error tolerances RTOL and ATOL have been increased
C                  to values the code estimates appropriate for
C                  continuing. The user may want to change them himself.
C                  If the user is sure he wants to continue with relaxed
C                  error tolerances, set INFO(1)=1 and call the code
C                  again.
C       IERR = -3  A solution component is zero and the user sets the
C                  corresponding component of ATOL to zero. If the user
C                  is sure he want to continue, he must first alter the
C                  error criterion to use positive values for those
C                  components of ATOL corresponding to zero solution
C                  components, then set INFO(1)=1 and call the code
C                  again.
C       IERR = -6  Repeated error test failures occurred on the last
C                  attempted step in DGELDA. A singularity in the
C                  solution may be present. If the user is absolutely
C                  certain he wants to continue, he should restart the
C                  integration.
C       IERR = -8  The linear system solver routines failed several
C                  times. It is possible that your problem is ill-posed,
C                  and cannot be solved using this code.
C       IERR = -10 IERR was repeatedly equal to minus one in EDIF, ADIF
C                  or FDIF. If you are absolutely certain you want to
C                  continue, you should restart the integration.
C       IERR = -21 IERR=-2 was encountered, and control is being
C                  returned to the calling program.
C       IERR = -22 DGELDA could not  determine the strangeness index. It
C                  is possible that your problem is ill-posed, and cannot
C                  be solved using this code.
C       IERR = -23 DGELDA could not compute an equivalent strangeness
C                  index zero system. It is possible that your problem
C                  is ill-posed, and cannot be solved using this code.
C       IERR = -24 DGELDA could not compute an initial X. It is
C                  possible that your problem is ill-posed, and cannot
C                  be solved using this code.
C       IERR = -25 DGELDA could not compute an initial derivative. It
C                  is possible that your problem is ill-posed, and
C                  cannot be solved using this code.
C       IERR = -26 The strangeness index or the characteristic values
C                  changed on the last step. It is possible that a
C                  solution to your problem either does not exist.
C
C                   *** Following a terminated task ***
C
C        IF IERR<-100 the user cannot continue the solution of this
C        problem. An attempt to do so will result in the users run being
C        terminated.
