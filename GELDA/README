DGELDA [4] is a software package for the numerical solution of linear
differential-algebraic equations with variable coefficients. The 
implementation is based on the new discretization scheme introduced
in [3]. It can deal with systems of arbitrary index and with systems
that do not  have unique solutions or inconsistencies in the initial
values or the inhomogeneity.  

The package includes a computation of all the local invariants of the
system, a regularization procedure and an index reduction scheme and
it can be combined with every solution method for standard index 1
systems. Nonuniqueness and inconsistencies are treated in a least
square sense. In our package we have implemented backward
differentiation formulas (BDF) methods [1] and Runge-Kutta (RK)
schemes [2].  

DGELDA is available via FTP or WWW. 

The compressed tar file dgelda-1.1.tar.Z contains the Fortran source
for DGELDA and a demo program. 

It also contains Fortran code for a subset of LAPACK and the Basic
Linear Algebra Subprograms (the Level 1, 2, and 3 BLAS) needed by
the LAPACK routines. However these codes are intended for use only if
there is no other implementation of LAPACK or the BLAS already
available on your machine; the efficiency of DGELDA and LAPACK 
depends very much on the efficiency of the BLAS.


Installing DGELDA:
==================

0. Getting the DGELDA:

Get the compressed tar file via 

  FTP: ftp.tu-chemnitz.de/pub/Local/mathematik/Rath/dgelda-1.1.tar.Z
or
  WWW: http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~rath/gelda.html

Uncompress and untar the tar file with the command

  uncompress -c dgelda-1.1.tar.Z | tar xf -


1. Edit the file dgelda-1.1/make.inc:

Before the libraries can be built you must define all machine
dependent parameters in the file dgelda-1.1/make.inc. Their you must
modify FORTRAN, FCOPTS, NOOPT, LOADER, LOADOPTS, ARCH, ARCHFLAGS,
RANLIB and LATEX to specify the compiler, compiler options, loader, loader
options, archiver, archiver options, ranlib and the LaTeX version for
your machine. 
Next, you must modify LAPACKLIB and BLASLIB. If LAPACK and/or the BLAS
are installed on your system you can specify the search path for these
libraries (e.g. BLASLIB = /usr/lib/blas.a) or you can use the -lx
loader option (e.g. BLASLIB = -lblas if the library libblas.a is in
the loader search path). If LAPACK or the BLAS are not installed 
on your system you should use the default settings.
Finally, you must change TIMESRC, TIMECOMP, TIMEOPTS and TIMELIB to
specify the source file, compiler, compiler options and libraries you 
need to compile and load a descnd.* routine. 

See the make.inc.HPUX, make.inc.Linux and make.inc.SUN for examples.   


2. Test and install the machine dependent routines:

Postscript and LaTeX versions of the LAPACK Quick Installation Guide
are in the dgelda-1.1/INSTALL directory, in the files lawn81.tex,
psfig.tex, lawn81.ps, and org2.ps. Consult the Installation Guide
(chapter 6.1) for further details on installing the machine dependent
routines in each subdirectory.  

You may need to supply a correct version of dsecnd.f or dsecnd.f for
your machine. You can change TIMESRC, TIMECOMP, TIMEOPTS and TIMELIB
in dgelda-1.1/make.inc to specify the source file, the compiler,
special compiler or loader options to compile and load dsecnd.f or
dsecnd.c.  
(NOTE, a quick and dirty way is to use dsecnd.f.no_etime, i.e. no
 timings are possible)

If you changed one of the machine dependent routines copy it into the
dgelda-1.1/LAPACK directory. 


3. Creating the LAPACK and/or BLAS library:

If LAPACK or the BLAS are not installed on your system use

	make lib  
	make blaslib
or 
	make lapacklib

to create both libraries, only the BLAS or only the LAPACK library.


4. Create the DGELDA Library and the demo program:

Just use
	
	make

to create the DGELDA library and the demo program. Start the program
with

	./demo

and you can choose between the BDF or RK method to solve the test
problem (See demo.out).


5. Create the library routine documents:

In dgelda-1.1/TeX directory you find the files 

	dgelda.tex  dnfix1.tex  dnfpen.tex  dnfval.tex
        dnfind.tex  dnfotr.tex  dnfred.tex

which are the LaTeX source files for the library routine
documents. You can use

	make docu

to create the documentation  (i.e. DVI files) in the dgelda-1.1/TeX
directory.  

The main library routine is the subroutine DGELDA which performs all
task to solve a linear DAE with variable coefficients. Additionally,
the documentation for the subroutines which perform the reduction of
a high strangeness index DAE to a strangeness free DAE is included.

Furthermore, the dgelda-1.1/TeX directory contains the file gelda1.ps
which gives on overview about the connections between the different
subroutines. 


History:
========

Version 1.1.1: October 12, 1995
	Some minor bugfixes. 
	A Linux version of the make.inc file.

Version 1.1  : July 19, 1995
	Changed order of the parameter in the DGELDA subroutine to meet
        the SLICOT [5] interface standard.
        Added equilibration of linear systems for the BDF solver,
        therefore we need additional space in RWORK (2*NEQ).

Version 1.0  : July 10, 1995
	Final release. This version of DGELDA is described in [4].
